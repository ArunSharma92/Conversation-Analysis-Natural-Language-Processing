Description: This project was done for my Social Computing Class ICSI 660. Here the dataset provided was a conversation between team members. The dataset has two seperate conversations from two different instances.

Firstly we had to run the two conversations from the dataset through the Stanford suite of tools and produce output for:
a) tokenizing
b) sentence splitting
c) part-of-speech tagging
d) lemmatizing
e) named entity recognition
